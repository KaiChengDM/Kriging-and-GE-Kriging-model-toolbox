# The matlab code include:

Gradient-enhanced Kriging surrogate model and corresponding Bayesian optimization algorithm

Sliced gradient-enhanced Kriging surrogate model and corresponding Bayesian optimization algorithm

Kriging model and corresponding Bayesian optimization algorithm

The code is deveoped by Kai Cheng. 

Sliced gradient-enhanced Kriging surrogate model is developed based on the following paper:

Cheng, Kai, and Ralf Zimmermann. "Sliced Gradient-Enhanced Kriging for High-Dimensional Function Approximation and Aerodynamic Modeling." https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03562
